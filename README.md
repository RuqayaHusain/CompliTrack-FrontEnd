## 📝 Project Description

**CompliTrack** is a web-based compliance tracking system designed to help small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Bahrain manage licenses and compliance deadlines in one place.  

The frontend provides a clean and user-friendly interface for users to register, log in, and monitor compliance-related data securely.

## 💡 Why CompliTrack?

Many SMEs rely on spreadsheets or reminders to track compliance obligations such as license renewals and filings. This often results in missed deadlines and penalties.  
CompliTrack simplifies this process by offering a centralized dashboard for tracking compliance activities.
